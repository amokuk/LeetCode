1. Given a sorted n-size array, there are k elements have been changed i.e. [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 12] (it might be changed from [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12] with k = 2).
    Important to know is that k is unknown and k is much smaller than n. The task is to re-sort the entire array.
   The interviewer wants O(n) solution. 

2. Card has 4 attributes (color, count, shading, shape), each attribute can have value 0, 1 or 2.
    3 cards are considered as a set if for each attribute, 3 cards either have the same value or have different value from each other. For example:
   card1 (2, 0, 1, 2), card2 (1, 0, 0, 1) and card3(0, 0, 2, 0) are 1 set.
   card1(2, 0, 1, 2), card2 (1, 1, 0, 1) and card3(0, 1, 2, 0) are not 1 set.

   a. write a boolean function with 3 cards as input. This function returns true if they are 1 set, otherwise returns false.
   b. Now given a collection of cards, return true if there is a set of cards exsits, otherwise return false. The interviewer wants O(n^2) solution.
