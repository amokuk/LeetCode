1. Given a sorted n-size array, there are k elements have been changed i.e. [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 12] (it might be changed from [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12] with k = 2).
    Important to know is that k is unknown and k is much smaller than n. The task is to re-sort the entire array.
   The interviewer wants O(n) solution. 

2. Card has 4 attributes (color, count, shading, shape), each attribute can have value 0, 1 or 2.
    3 cards are considered as a set if for each attribute, 3 cards either have the same value or have different value from each other. For example:
   card1 (2, 0, 1, 2), card2 (1, 0, 0, 1) and card3(0, 0, 2, 0) are 1 set.
   card1(2, 0, 1, 2), card2 (1, 1, 0, 1) and card3(0, 1, 2, 0) are not 1 set.

   a. write a boolean function with 3 cards as input. This function returns true if they are 1 set, otherwise returns false.
   b. Now given a collection of cards, return true if there is a set of cards exsits, otherwise return false. The interviewer wants O(n^2) solution.

3. Given an array i.e. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] and a value k i.e. 3. If there is a subarray with length of 2k satisfies a sequence
    [a, a + 1, a + 2 ... a + k - 1, b, b + 1, b + 2... b + k - 1]. Return the beginning index of this subarray.
    So with given array [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] and k = 3, it can return 0 as [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] satisfies the sequence requirement.
    If with given array [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] and k = 3, it return -1 as there is no such subarray exsits.

4.  a CPU task is defined as Task(id, queued_time, exec_time).
    Id is the task's id; queued_time is the time when the task joins the queue;
    exec_time is the time needed to execuate the task.
    Given a collection of CPU tasks return the order of task ids thats been executed by one-core evil CPU.
    For example (1, 2, 2), (2, 5, 15), (3, 5, 10) would return 1, 3, 2. The reason is that at 2nd second, task#1 joined the queue and it's the only one in the queue.
    It's been executed first. At 4th second, task#1 is finished.
    CPU is in idling state. At 5th second, task#2 and task#3 joined the queue.
    CPU will first execute task#3 as task#3 has smaller exec_time.
    At 15th second, task#3 is finished.
    Task #2 is still in the queue. Task#2 will be execuated. So the order of execuation is 1, 3, 2.

5.  一开始问知不知道graph，我说了下定义和各种graph，他要我用code写一个图的定义，我给了两种方法，他说好吧，我们就用第二种。
    然后coding是序列化和反序列化一个图。边写边讨论解释，最后表示满意

6.  第一道题是给methodA，有一半的几率返回true，一半的几率返回false，要求用这个method，和给一个double 0 <= p <=1,
    写一个methodB，有p的几率返回true，1-p的几率返回false。感觉这是好老的题了，卡了一下，
    面试官提醒如果没有第一个method，怎么做，我说用random，他就让我写了个random的解法，后来自己想出来正确的解法.
